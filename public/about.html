<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a wanna be front end developer. I am currently learning web development and i want to get job as as a front end web developer
  but it seems like that the getting job is not an easy task. It is going to be tough task. 
</p>

<p>
  There is a lack of consistency in studying from my side. I want to get the job as soon as possible so that i would get free air 
  Now i am getting lazy which is not good for me.
